# Image Classification App
This repository provides the source code to create the models used in [the TensorFlowlite image classification application](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/examples/image_classification/overview).  
I created this program because [the official example application](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/hosted_models) only allows the use of trained models.  
By following the steps and executing the code, you can create an Android application that classifies images using images prepared by you and network models created by you.
